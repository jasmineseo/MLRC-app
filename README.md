# Goals
The goal of our project is to ceate a website for the [Modern Language Resource Center (MLRC)](https://community.scrippscollege.edu/mlrc/) at Scripps College. 
The website will allow students who visit the language center to
1. check-in for their tutoring sessions by leaving information on their language, type of service, home school, etc.  
2. make appointments prior to visiting based on the tutor's availability
3. leave feedback on their experience at the center or with a specific tutor    

The administrator can 
1. view and download various statistics of the users of MLRC, such as their school, language, etc.
2. view and download feedback from students
3. manage the list of languages and tutors
4. manage the admin account, check-in, and feedback form
